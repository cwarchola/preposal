# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO
I want to create a webpage called "The Magic Snowball" that will predict snow days based on the same 
parameters that the City of Philadelphia uses to declare a snow emergency. The reason for that is 
because many organizations rely on this to make decisions for their own organizations in regards to snow
closings.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO
Solo project

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO
None, for now.
